# CSC271 Final Project
 
Our website is an information site about the ocean and its inhabitants. We have 4 pages, a home page and 3 pages each about a different kind of oceanic creature. The pages consit of interactive information slides and cards where you can click on a card to change the picture and information that appear at the top of the page. Our homepage also has a carousel that is cycling through a bunch of different animal photos.
